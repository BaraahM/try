**Files to Create Later (Phase 2):**
- `aws/infrastructure-k3s/` - K3s Terraform
- `aws/k3s/` - Kubernetes manifests  
- `aws/environments/growth.tfvars`

**Files to Create Later (Phase 3):**
- `aws/infrastructure/` - EKS Terraform
- `aws/kubernetes/` - Production K8s manifests
- `aws/environments/production.tfvars`

## ⚡ **Quick Start (MVP Deployment)**

### 1. **Prerequisites Setup (30 minutes)**
```bash
# AWS Account Setup
aws iam create-user --user-name barum-deploy
# Add policies: EC2, S3, CloudFront, Route53, Secrets, ECR, ELB

# Domain Setup  
aws route53 list-hosted-zones # Note your zone ID

# Terraform State Bucket
aws s3 mb s3://barum-terraform-state-$(date +%s)
```

### 2. **Configure Environment (15 minutes)**
```bash
# Update aws/environments/mvp.tfvars
domain_name = "yourdomain.com"
route53_zone_id = "Z1234567890ABC"
ssh_public_key = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3N..."

# Set GitLab CI/CD Variables (protected)
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
TF_VAR_database_url, TF_VAR_jwt_secret, TF_VAR_supabase_*
```

### 3. **Deploy Infrastructure (10 minutes)**
```bash
cd aws/infrastructure-mvp
terraform init -backend-config="bucket=$TERRAFORM_STATE_BUCKET"
terraform apply -var-file="../environments/mvp.tfvars"
# Note: instance_public_ip, load_balancer_dns_name
```

### 4. **Deploy Application (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Push to GitLab main branch
# Manually trigger 'deploy_mvp' job in GitLab CI/CD
# Access: https://yourdomain.com
```

**Total Setup Time: ~1 hour**

## 🔄 **Migration Procedures**

### **Phase 1 → Phase 2 (MVP to K3s)**
**When to Migrate:** $1K+ MRR, 1K+ users, team of 3+

**Preparation Week:**
1. Create K3s infrastructure alongside MVP
2. Install K3s: `curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh`
3. Convert Docker Compose to Kubernetes manifests
4. Test deployment in parallel

**Migration Day (2-hour window):**
1. Deploy apps to K3s cluster
2. Update DNS to new Load Balancer  
3. Verify health checks pass
4. Terminate MVP instance
5. **Downtime: <5 minutes**

### **Phase 2 → Phase 3 (K3s to EKS)**
**When to Migrate:** $10K+ MRR, 10K+ users, team of 5+

**Preparation Weeks:**
1. Create EKS infrastructure
2. Install External Secrets Operator, ALB Controller
3. Migrate secrets and configurations
4. Test all integrations

**Migration Day (4-hour window):**
1. Backup K3s cluster: `kubectl get all -o yaml > backup.yaml`
2. Deploy to EKS with blue-green strategy
3. Migrate any persistent data
4. Update DNS to EKS ALB
5. **Downtime: <30 minutes**

## 🛡️ **Risk Mitigation**

### **Backup Strategies**
- **Phase 1:** Environment config backup, Supabase handles DB
- **Phase 2:** K3s cluster backup, persistent volume snapshots  
- **Phase 3:** Velero automated backups, multi-AZ redundancy

### **Rollback Plans**
- **DNS Rollback:** Instant switch via Route 53 (all phases)
- **Container Rollback:** Previous image deployment (2 minutes)
- **Infrastructure Rollback:** Terraform state restore (10 minutes)

### **Monitoring Alerts**
- **Cost Alerts:** $50, $75, $100 thresholds
- **Health Alerts:** 5xx errors, high latency, downtime
- **Resource Alerts:** CPU >80%, Memory >90%, Disk >85%

## 💰 **Cost Optimization Guide**

### **Phase 1 Optimizations**
- ✅ Use t3.small (sufficient for MVP)
- ✅ CloudWatch logs: 7-day retention
- ✅ S3 lifecycle policies for old assets
- ✅ Cost anomaly detection enabled

### **Additional Savings**
- **Reserved Instances:** Save 40% with 1-year commitment
- **Spot Instances:** Save 70% for non-critical workloads  
- **S3 Intelligent Tiering:** Automatic cost optimization
- **CloudFront Regional Edge:** Reduce data transfer costs

## 📈 **Success Metrics to Track**

### **Business KPIs**
```bash
Monthly Recurring Revenue: $0 → $1K → $10K+
Active Users: 0 → 1K → 10K+  
Daily API Requests: 0 → 10K → 100K+
Customer Acquisition Cost: Track vs Infrastructure %
```

### **Technical KPIs**
```bash
Response Time: <200ms (95th percentile)
Uptime: 99.5% → 99.9% → 99.95%
Error Rate: <0.1%
Deployment Frequency: Daily → Multiple per day
```

### **Cost KPIs**
```bash
Cost per User: <$0.05 → <$0.01 → <$0.005
Infrastructure % of Revenue: 100% → 10% → 4%
Monthly Infrastructure Cost: $45 → $105 → $412
```

# Summary of Modifications to Barum App

## Architectural Changes

### New Editor Package Structure

- Added `packages/plate-editor/`: A new standalone editor package that can be imported and used across the application  
- Modified `packages/editor.v1-main/`: The original editor package has been significantly refactored  
- Enhanced `packages/web-next/`: Now integrates the new plate-editor package

## Editor Integration in Web-Next

- New route: `packages/web-next/app/(editor)/editor/page.tsx` - A dedicated editor page  
- New layout: `packages/web-next/app/(editor)/layout.tsx` - Editor-specific layout with proper styling  
- Dynamic imports: The editor is now loaded dynamically with SSR disabled for better performance

## Key Technical Improvements

### Package Dependencies & Build System

- New `@barum/plate-editor` package: Published as a workspace package with proper exports  
- Build configuration: Added `tsup.config.ts` for building the editor package  
- Client-side rendering: Added `ClientOnly.tsx` component to handle SSR issues  
- Removed `pnpm-lock.yaml`: Switched from pnpm to yarn for consistency across the monorepo

### Editor Component Refactoring

- Simplified toolbar components: Removed complex export/import functionality from individual toolbar buttons  
- Streamlined media handling: Simplified media toolbar button with basic file/image/video support  
- Removed emoji dropdown: Deleted `emoji-dropdown-menu.tsx` to reduce complexity  
- Enhanced settings: Added new settings functionality in the editor

## UI/UX Enhancements

### Editor Interface Improvements

- Better layout separation: Editor now has its own dedicated layout with proper font loading  
- Improved styling: Added editor-specific global CSS (`editor-globals.css`)  
- Template support: Added template preview functionality in `TemplatePreview.tsx`  
- Responsive design: Better handling of editor container sizing

### Component Architecture

- Wrapper pattern: Created `PlateEditorWrapper` component for better integration  
- Suspense boundaries: Added proper loading states for the editor  
- Error handling: Improved error boundaries and fallback states

## Development Workflow Changes

### Package Management

- Yarn workspace integration: All packages now use yarn consistently  
- Dependency updates: Updated various package versions across the monorepo  
- Build optimization: Improved build processes with better TypeScript configuration

### Code Organization

- Separation of concerns: Editor logic is now properly separated from the main application  
- Reusable components: Editor can now be imported and used in multiple places  
- Better type safety: Enhanced TypeScript configurations and type exports

## üìù Notes on Migration Strategy: Mantine Integration Options

### Option 1: Manually Convert Plate.js Files to Mantine

**Effort & Timeline:**
- Already copied a large number of Plate.js files (core, plugins, UI, hooks).
- To "adjust all of them to be Mantine-based" requires:
  - Refactoring every component to use Mantine primitives instead of Tailwind/shadcn/ui/Radix.
  - Rewriting all styles (dozens of files).
  - Replacing all UI logic (menus, dialogs, toolbars, overlays) with Mantine equivalents.
  - Fixing all import paths and resolving deep dependency chains.
  - Testing and debugging every feature (AI, collaboration, uploads, versioning, etc.).
- **Estimated effort**: Several weeks (potentially longer with AI tools like Cursor or Claude, as they will require lots of context and iterative fixes for each file due to the complexity and cross-dependencies).
- **Risks**: High risk of regressions, missed edge cases, and ongoing maintenance burden as Plate.js and Mantine both update.

---

### Option 2: Make the Editor a Package/Dependency

**Effort & Timeline:**
- Extract the editor (from `editor-main`) as a standalone package (`@barum/plate-editor`).
- Publish it to the monorepo (as a local package or npm package).
- Expose a clear API/component for usage in the Mantine-based app.
- Only adapt the top-level wrapper or a few integration points to Mantine (e.g., modals, notifications, theme).
- **Estimated effort**: Days for initial packaging and integration, plus some time for Mantine theming at the interface boundary.
- **Risks**: Much lower. Update the editor package independently.

---

**Summary:**
- **Manual conversion**: Weeks of work, high risk, not recommended.
- **Editor as a package**: 2‚Äì5 days, lower risk, easier to maintain, recommended.

| Approach               | User Experience           | Effort     | Maintainability | Risks   |
|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|-----------------|---------|
| Editor as a Package    | Seamless, unified, fast   | Low‚ÄìMedium | High            | Low     |
| Manual File Conversion | Risk of bugs, mismatches  | High       | Low             | High    |
